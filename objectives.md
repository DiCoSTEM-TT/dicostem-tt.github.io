# Objectives & Methods

## Specific Objectives (OEs)

- **OE1**: Conduct an initial diagnosis and analysis of the variables connecting the **digital, cognitive, and emotional** domains involved in STEM teaching/learning processes in **hybrid learning environments** for pre-service teachers.
- **OE2**: Design a **metacognitive training plan** for the acquisition of **professional competences** related to **digital, pedagogical, and scientific-technological** aspects in pre-service teachers.
- **OE3**: Design and analyse, from a **multidimensional perspective**, **models for integrating virtual laboratories (with and without AI)** for STEM teaching and learning, grounded in **active methodologies** and targeted at **different educational stages**, from early years to teacher education.
- **OE4**: Develop **digital teaching materials** for integration into STEM teaching and learning processes in **hybrid** educational environments.
- **OE5**: Design and develop **procedures and instruments** to assess **students**.
- **OE6**: **Analyse and evaluate** the implementation of digital teaching materials in **Virtual Laboratories** (with and without AI) for **digital STEM Education** across **different educational levels**, tracking changes in variables related to the **digital, cognitive, and emotional** domains in hybrid learning contexts.
- **OE7**: **Disseminate** results and conclusions throughout the project via **publications**, **events**, **seminars/conferences**, and **open materials**.

## Methods (overview)
Mixed-methods design combining exploratory and quasi-experimental studies with control/experimental groups, pre/post tests, validated instruments (incl. adapted SELFIEforTeachers), and design-based research cycles for materials and virtual labs.
