# DiCoSTEM-TT — GitHub Pages Starter

**How to publish**

1. Create the repository on GitHub.
2. Upload this folder's contents to the repo root (or `/docs` if you want to publish from there).
3. Enable **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch** (main / root).
4. Visit your site at `https://<your-user>.github.io/` (or `https://<your-user>.github.io/<repo>`).

**Customise**

- Replace `<your-user>` and `<your-repo>` in `_config.yml` and contact links.
- Add publications under `/results/` (one file per output).
- Upload assets to `assets/` and large files to Zenodo and link them.
